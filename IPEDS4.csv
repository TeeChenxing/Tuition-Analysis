"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. However, the U.S. service academies are not included in this table. Amounts are institutional averages as reported by the institution, not average amounts paid by students (i.e., charges are not weighted by enrollment). Percentage change was computed using unrounded average costs. The time points displayed in this table were chosen to demonstrate the range of data available from IPEDS for trend analysis, not to emphasize any particular period of change. Out-of-state average tuition and required fees were used for private institutions that reported varying tuitions by residency. Institutions with academic calendars that differ by program or allow continuous enrollment are not included in this table. All amounts from 2017–18 were converted to 2019 dollars using the average Consumer Price Index values for the 12-month periods ending in December 2017 and December 2019. Data from both time points in this table are from the same source. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.",,,,,,,,,,,,
