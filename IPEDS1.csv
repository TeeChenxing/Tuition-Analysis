"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. However, the U.S. service academies are not included in this table. Amounts are institutional averages as reported by the institution, not average amounts paid by students (i.e., charges are not weighted by enrollment). The time points displayed in this table were chosen to demonstrate the range of data available from IPEDS for trend analysis, not to emphasize any particular period of change. Out-of-state average tuition and required fees were used for private institutions that reported varying tuitions by residency. These figures may differ from the tuition and required fee charges in table 6 that apply to all full-time undergraduates. The average components of academic year cost of attendance in this table may not sum to the corresponding average cost of attendance in table 9 because not all institutions report all components of academic year cost of attendance separately (e.g., an institution may report a comprehensive fee in lieu of the individual components). The 2,380 institutions with academic calendars that differ by program or allow continuous enrollment are not included. All amounts from 2014–15 were converted to 2016–17 dollars using the average Consumer Price Index values for the 12-month periods ending in October 2014 and October 2016. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.
